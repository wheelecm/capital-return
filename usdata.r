### History:
###
### Programming by Paul Gomme.
###
### The original work, for Gomme and Rupert (2007), was done in Microsoft
### Excel. At the time, I (Paul Gomme) worked at the Federal Reserve Bank of
### Cleveland where I had access to Haver Analytics data which was accessed
### through Excel. Consequently, it seemed natural to keep all the data work
### within Excel.
###
### However, when trying to maintain the data and update it for subsequent
### work, Excel proved to be a nightmare. Links to columns made no sense
### since they were not descriptive of the data being linked to. I tried use
### tabs to organize the data, but this just meant that tracing back to the
### definition of variables was even harder. To make it easier to maintain
### the data, I eventually switched to Matlab. This was workable and I could
### assign meaningful names to variables so that the various data
### manipulations are somewhat more transparent. However, I still needed
### someone at a Federal Reserve Bank to help out every so often updating an
### Excel spreadsheet withe the raw data. So, there was a 2 step process:
### update the data in Excel, then bring the data into Matlab.  The second
### operation is easier under Microsoft Windows, and only a bit more
### complicated under Linux (my preferred operating system since 2008).
###
### More recently, B. Ravikumar encouraged the maintainers of the St. Louis
### Fed's FRED to put up the data needed for this work. Translation of the
### Matlab code to R ensured and this file is the end product. Thanks to Lin
### Shao, then of the St. Louis Fed, for figuring out most of the FRED codes
### corresponding to the data below.

### R can be downloaded from https://www.r-project.org/

### A friendly GUI for R is available at https://www.rstudio.com/home/
